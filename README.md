# NonCommutative Formal Power Series

## Description

NonCommutative Formal Power Series (NCFPS) is a Mathematica-based package for working with formal power series over noncommutative variables. It implements basic algebraic operations like the concatenation product and the shuffle product, as well as special purpose operations used in nonlinear control theory.

## Documentation

Descriptions and interactive examples of the included functions are available in the attached [documentation notebook](Documentation/Documentation.nb).

## Installation

The package can most easily be setup by running the [installation notebook](Package/installer.nb).

Manual setup is also possible a number of ways. The simplest is likely placing the [**Package** directory](Package) in any directory on Mathematica's search path. These locations can be listed by evaluating `$Path` in a Mathematica notebook.
